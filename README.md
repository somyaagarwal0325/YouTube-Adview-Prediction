# YouTube-Adview-Prediction

The project involved developing and testing various Machine Learning models, after data preprocessing, to closely predict the number of views an advertisement on YouTube would get.

### Prerequisites

* The dataset was cleaned and analysed.
* Various graphs were plotted to visualise the data spread.
* Heatmaps were generated to better understand data corelation
* Columns were added and dropped as per the requirement to prepare the data as input to the model.

### Model Building

* Various models were built like Linear Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest, SVR, ANN, etc.
* These were then tested on varios performance parameters like R2 Sore, Mean Squared Error, etc.
* They were compared to each other and the best performing model was selected to predict Adviews.

## End Result

Decision Tree Regressor model was chosen as our predictor with an R2 Score of almost 50%.
